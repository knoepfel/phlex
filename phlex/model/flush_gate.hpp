// flush_gate
//
// A flush_gate is a per-parent-index completion detector: for a given data_cell_index, it
// decides when the parent's entire subtree of descendant data cells has been accounted for
// and the parent is therefore ready to emit a flush (end-of-subtree token).
//
// One flush_gate is created per data_cell_index by index_router, keyed by the index's hash.
// It accumulates three independent streams of information about that index's subtree:
//
//   1. Expected child counts per child layer, supplied by unfold operations via
//      update_expected_count().  The gate waits for `expected_flush_count` such messages
//      (one per unfold consuming the parent's layer) before treating the expectation as
//      complete.
//
//   2. Rollups of committed counts from non-lowest-layer direct children, recorded via
//      roll_up_child() and balanced against an announced expectation set by
//      expect_child_rollups().  This is a signed counter that must reach zero before the
//      gate opens.
//
//   3. Lowest-layer children, which require no per-arrival accounting: their announced
//      count is the final count and is merged into committed_counts_ at commit time.
//
// Readiness (all_children_accounted()) is a quiescence test: all expected flush messages
// must have arrived AND all expected non-lowest rollups must have been received.  When
// that holds, the gate commits (merges expected_counts_ into committed_counts_) and the
// router walks up to the parent, rolling this gate's counts into the grandparent via
// roll_up_child().
